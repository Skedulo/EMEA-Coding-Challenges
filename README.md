## EMEA Coding Challenges Page

Welcome to the Skedulo coding challenges page, this page is to help you choose which type of test you would like to do for your coding challenge as part of the interview process at Skedulo.


We know everyone is different so we want to offer a choice on how you would like to go about the coding challenge part of the interview.

## Our tests:
**Front end test: https://github.com/Skedulo/frontend-tech-test**

**Back end test: https://github.com/Skedulo/backend-tech-test/tree/skeleton/kotlin**

## The Options

### Option 1: A mix of Take home and pairing review


* A take-home test of around an hour, we don't care about “completing” the challenge as this is more about you having some code that we can then go through in person as part of a pairing & peer review.
* The 2nd part of this test is an “in person” (over zoom) review of around an hour where we will talk through choices made, tests and sometimes add some extra functionality.


### Option 2: Pairing exercise



* Straight to a pairing exercise. This is where you will pair up with one of the Skedulo engineers and complete a challenge just like you would when normally pairing on a task on a day-to-day basis.


## Overall Guidance for our tests
For either a take home test or pairing up with one of our engineers, keep the following in mind:
Approach this problem any way you like, we are not expecting perfection or a specific solution.

The test should only take about an hour, don't feel you have to rush a solution but dont feel that you need to complete the whole test either, you will not be judged on whether you finish or not. 
We would much rather you give us a solution that you are proud of and feel best displays the type of code you are happy with, as time is limited you might not get to the kind of solution you would want to ship so please call that out (either in the readme or in person if pairing).

Tests are not a hard requirement but are strongly encouraged; feel free to choose what coverage you want to do for this test.
