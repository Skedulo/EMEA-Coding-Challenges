# # EMEA Coding Challenges Page

Welcome to the Skedulo coding challenges page, this page is to help you choose which type of test you would like to do for your coding challenge as part of the interview process for Skedulo.

 \
We know everyone is different so we wanted to offer a choice on how you would like to go about the coding challenge part of the interview.


# The Options


## Option 1:



* A take-home test of around an hour, we don't care about “completing” the challenge as this is more about you having some code that we can then go through in person as part of a pairing & peer review.
* The 2nd part of this test is an “in person” (over zoom) review of around an hour where we will talk through choices made, the tests and sometimes adding some extra functionality.


## Option 2



* Straight to a pairing exercise where you will pair up with one of the Skedulo engineers and complete a challenge just like you would when normally pairing on a task on a day to day basis.
